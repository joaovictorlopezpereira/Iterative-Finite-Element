# Iterative-Finite-Elements

This repository presents a comparison of different methods for solving a matrix-vector system generated by the finite element method. The techniques evaluated include:

- Julia's backslash operator;
- Gauss-Jacobi;
- Parallel Gauss-Jacobi;
- Tri-diagonal Gauss-Jacobi;
- Parallel Tri-diagonal Gauss-Jacobi;
- Gauss-Seidel;
- Tri-diagonal Gauss-Seidel.

Details about the implementation are provided in the ``iterative_finite_elements.jl`` file, while the analysis results are summarized in the ``report.pdf`` file.

For further information on the finite element method, refer to the [Finite-Element-Method](https://github.com/joaovictorlopezpereira/Finite-Element-Method) repository.

The slides in the ``slides.pdf`` file were presented as the final project for the Scientific Computing and Data Analysis course at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).
